    </div>
    <div id="top" class="pbr">
      <p id="firstp">

      TXJS is well-known and well-respected as one of the best front-end
      developer conferences the community has to offer.  The event is in loose
      affiliation with the JSConf series of conferences, and in just two years,
      it has already established itself as a must-attend event. This year's
      TXJS will be held on <b>June 14 in Austin, Texas</b>.</p>

      <p>

      As the organizers of TXJS, we believe that a community-oriented
      conference should come as close as possible to breaking even, and that we
      should spend more on the attendees than they paid to be there. TXJS
      puts a strong emphasis on technical talks that help attendees improve their
      understanding of the JavaScript and front-end development landscape --
      talks that range from the history of the creation of JavaScript, to the
      implementation of new CSS features and beginner front-end techniques.

      </p>

      <p>

      These core values mean that TXJS draws a highly diverse and highly
      skilled audience.  Thanks to our sponsors in the past, we've been able to
      keep the admission cost very low. In 2010, tickets for the conference
      started at $29 and eventually landed at $109 on the day of the
      conference. Last year, after a move to a downtown venue, we sold tickets
      for $149 to $179. Our goal is to attract passionate developers, not just
      the ones whose companies can afford to foot the bill. We believe this
      creates a much better "hallway track" and a much more appealing
      audience for our sponsors.

      </p>

      <p>

      Each sponsor receives a certain number of tickets to the event, depending
      on the sponsorship level. We encourage our sponsors to use the tickets to
      send well-informed, technical employees to the event ready to engage with
      attendees, rather than an HR representative who will sit at a table.
      Because we value these genuine conversations over conversations that
      occur across a sponsorship table, we have chosen a venue that will be
      conducive to them; sponsors will not have tables or banners, but they
      will have the opportunity to place small swag (stickers, buttons, pens)
      at the tables where attendees will sit. Sponsor logos will be prominent
      on the screens during breaks, and there will be a room dedicated to hacking
      and conversation.

      </p>

      <p>

      Finally and importantly: Sponsorships are reserved only upon payment in
      full. We look forward to seeing you at TXJS 2012!
