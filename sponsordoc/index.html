      <h1>2012 Sponsorship Information</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="top" class="pbr">
      <p id="firstp">
      The Texas JavaScript Conference (TXJS) is one of the most well-known and well-respected Front-End Developer conferences
      among the members of the JavaScript Community. The event is in loose affiliation with the JSConf series of conferences and is gaining
      popularity as another must-attend conference. This year's TXJS is a one-day event, taking place on <b>June 14, 2012</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our core monetary philosophies at TXJS are that we should come as close as we can to breaking-even &mdash; and that we should spend more
      on the attendees than they paid to be there. We are a not-for-profit conference. TXJS has a large amount of highly technical 
      talks ranging from the creation of JavaScript to the implementation of new CSS features and beginner front-end techniques. Because 
      of these core values, we draw a highly diverse and highly skilled audience.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thanks to our sponsors in the past, we've been able to keep the admission cost as low as possible for TXJS events. In 2010
      the tickets for the conference started at $29 and eventually landed at $109 on the day of the conference. Last year, after
      a move to a downtown venue, we sold tickets for $149-$179. This is in stark contrast to other similar conferences in the
      JavaScript and front-end space that charge upwards of $1300 for a 2-day event. Our goal is to attract passionate developers
      rather than the ones who can have their company pay for their conference for them. We believe this creates a much better
      "hallway track" and a much more applicable audience for our sponsors.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unlike many events, in our venue there is not a common area that people walk through regularly. For this reason, we are deciding
      to not do tables and bags this year. All sponsors will be allowed to enter the venue early to place small swag (stickers, buttons, pens)
      on the tables where the attendees will sit. Rather than having banners in the hallway, we will put all sponsor logos on the idle screens
      between talks. We find that using your provided tickets to send well-informed technical employees (usually wearing company gear) to the
      conference is a better way to engage the attendees than sending HR employees to a table in the hall (we promise).
      </p>
      <p>
      All sponsorships are reserved only upon payment
