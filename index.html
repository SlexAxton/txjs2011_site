            <aside> 
            <p>Computer programs are the most complicated stuff that people make. Computer programs must be perfect, and people are not good at that. JavaScript is one of our least perfect programming languages. But there are positive things that can reduce your error rate and enhance your beauty.</p>

            <aside> 
            <p>The road to jQuery success is paved with the guts of bugs slain along the way. At "Fixing These jQuery", you'll understand how to approach your jQuery and JavaScript problems methodologically, and we'll cover many of the common caveats that every jQuery user encounters sooner or later. You'll learn what you should do when your code doesn't do what it should. Sure, docs and support can provide a quick leg up when you're in a pinch, but once you arm yourself with the right tools and knowledge, you can traverse the thorniest of thickets!</p>

Underneath it all is WebKit, HTML, and JavaScript, powering both applications and system services. This talk will highlight our next-generation JS application framework, Enyo, and also look at how node.js is used to provide system services and background processing.</p>

            <p>Way too many of today's presentations use JavaScript for needless bling. Use CSS for simple animations and present static content for browsers that do not support them. Let go of your need to control your user's experience pixel by pixel.</p>
            <p>I will show a few demos of using CSS animations and how to provide similar non-animated options for browsers that do not support them.</p>

            <p>When you first think of iframes, you probably think of embedded YouTube videos and web forms. But iframes can do a lot more than just embed third-party content. As an inline, sandboxed DOM environment, the iframe is a powerful tool for communicating across domains, loading resources asynchronously, securing content, and more. In this talk we'll explore a number of helpful ways to script iframes, both conventional and not. (Mostly not.)</p>

            <aside> 
            <p>In late 2010, Toura Mobile had developed a PhoneGap-based platform for creating content-rich mobile applications, and customers were buying. The problem was that customers were also asking for more and more complex features, and Toura was rapidly discovering that their platform was more of a prototype than a solid base for future development. In this session, I'll talk about the decision to start from scratch, what we did differently the second time around, how we used features of the Dojo Toolkit to smooth the process, and how we designed the new solution with an emphasis on expecting the unexpected.</p>

            <aside> 
            <p>This whole mobile internet thing is probably gonna work out, but you may be asking yourself, with all the various ways of building mobile apps with web technologies, which one is right for me? There are so many choices, how does one choose?!</p>
            <p>Don't fret! Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys">Hardy Boys</a>, we will choose the right path to end up with the right framework for your design and development style.</a>
          <p>The frameworks we'll cover include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>jQuery Mobile</li>
            <li>Sencha Touch</li>
            <li>Phonegap</li>
            <li>Appecelerator</li>
            <li>Titanium</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We'll cover what's right and what's wrong so that you don't end up getting fired (<a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/hl-3373204/the_office_safety_training_season_3/">or shunned and reshunned</a>). There will be some demos and most likely all the code will be given away MIT license style.</p>

            <p>The top chefs in the world are specialists in taking basic ingredients, combining them in new and novel ways, and presenting them in ways that delight and amaze their guests.</p>
            <p>As frontend programmers, we can learn a lot learn from these gastronomic figureheads; from their scientific approach to choosing, combining and cooking ingredients, to their obsession over service, senses and overall experience.</p>
            <p>This is a talk about the relationship between food and code, between fine dining  and web applications and ultimately how we can take inspiration from the masters of cuisine to help us build better software for everyone.</p>

            <aside> 
            <p>The idea of animating HTML elements with JavaScript was first proposed centuries ago, even before computers existed, but has only been possible for roughly fifteen years.</p>
            <p>Now, in 2011, we've got about nineteen different ways to animate elements. How do they differ? Which approaches are supported in which browsers? What works on mobile devices? And, most importantly: can we abstract away the differences between them and arrive at a solution that Just Works?</p>
            <p>Well... it's complicated. I'll be sharing the battle scars I've earned while working on scripty2 and the Gowalla web site. I'll try to explain how (and why) we got here, what works where (both on the desktop and on mobile devices), and what the challenges are for frontend developers who want to do bulletproof animation in web browsers.</p>

            <aside> 
            <p>It doesn't matter whether you write JavaScript for the client, the server, or for both. It doesn't matter what library or framework you use. It doesn't matter what templating engine or node modules you rely on. The end result is HTML. And if your HTML sucks, what was the point? If you've been thinking markup was someone else's concern, guess what, sweetcheeks: it's not - it's yours. We obsess over extra semi-colons but we'll add container element after container element to provide hooks for our jQuery plugins? Uh-uh. If there's no craftsmanship involved in the way you handle HTML, it's time to change that.</p>
