			<h3>Things you'll need to know the day of the conference</h3>
			<h3>...and don't forget about the extra-curricular activities</h3>
          <p>We can't wait to see you in Austin on June 11. Make sure you get there with enough time to 
          get registered and have a few breakfast tacos (sponsored by Yammer) before the talks start. There 
          are quite a few Alamo Drafthouses in Austin, so don't get confused - we are at the Alamo Drafthouse 
          Ritz on 6th St. in downtown Austin. Street parking is free on the weekends.</p>

          <p>You'll have easy access to power and plentiful Wifi (sponsored by Headspring). Lunch is provided (thanks to Mozilla!). The Alamo Drafthouse has table space for 
          everyone and you'll have table service at lunch. Also, all day long, if you'd like some local beer, 
          trade in some drink tickets (sponsored by Strobe) for a pint and responsibly relax while you learn.</p>

          <p>Don't forget to join us for a Beer.js drinkup (sponsored by HP/Palm) at The Gingerman 
          (301 Lavaca St.) from 5-8pm on Friday night before the conference. You'll need to check in at a marked 
          table to get on the conference tab. Then feel free to go out with friends or get a good night's sleep 
          so we can get started bright and early on Saturday morning.</p>

          <p>After the conference we'll be having a party at Buffalo Billiards (sponsored by Bazaarvoice). 
          Conference badges will be required. Light snacks will be provided and Texas Beer will be on 
          the house. The party will start immediately following the conference and be open 'til will 
          leave. Yammer and Mozilla have teamed up to help you learn the city a bit, too. Details at the party.</p>

            <p>The road to jQuery success is paved with the guts of bugs slain along the way. At "Fixing These jQuery", you'll understand how to approach your jQuery and JavaScript problems methodologically, and we'll cover many of the common caveats that every jQuery user encounters sooner or later. You'll learn what you should do when your code doesn't do what it should. Sure, docs and support can provide a quick leg up when you're in a pinch, but once you arm yourself with the right tools and knowledge, you can traverse the thorniest of thickets!</p>

            <p>With the mainstreaming of server-side JavaScript, the possibility of full-stack 
            JavaScript development finally seems to be coming to fruition. Writing once, and running 
            the same code everywhere seems like the obvious big win, along with the ease of writing 
            complex server-side applications in a simple, flexible language like JavaScript. Actually, 
            full-stack JS is awesome, but these aren't necessarily the reasons why. This talk will bust 
            some of the myths about full-stack JS development, and take a realistic look at the real 
            benefits of 'JS everywhere.'</p>

As an inline, sandboxed DOM environment, the iframe is a powerful tool for communicating across domains, loading resources asynchronously, securing content, and more. In this talk we'll explore a number of helpful ways to script iframes, both conventional and not. (Mostly not.)</p>

            <p>In late 2010, Toura Mobile had developed a PhoneGap-based platform for creating content-rich mobile applications, and customers were buying. The problem was that customers were also asking for more and more complex features, and Toura was rapidly discovering that their platform was more of a prototype than a solid base for future development. In this session, I'll talk about the decision to start from scratch, what we did differently the second time around, how we used features of the Dojo Toolkit to smooth the process, and how we designed the new solution with an emphasis on expecting the unexpected.</p>

            <p>Don't fret! Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys">Hardy Boys</a>, we will choose the right path to end up with the right framework for your design and development style.</p>

            <p>The top chefs in the world are specialists in taking basic ingredients, combining them in new and novel ways, and presenting them in ways that delight and amaze their guests.</p>
            <p>As frontend programmers, we can learn a lot learn from these gastronomic figureheads; from their scientific approach to choosing, combining and cooking ingredients, to their obsession over service, senses and overall experience.</p>
            <p>This is a talk about the relationship between food and code, between fine dining  and web applications and ultimately how we can take inspiration from the masters of cuisine to help us build better software for everyone.</p>

            <p>The idea of animating HTML elements with JavaScript was first proposed centuries ago, even before computers existed, but has only been possible for roughly fifteen years.</p>
            <p>Now, in 2011, we've got about nineteen different ways to animate elements. How do they differ? Which approaches are supported in which browsers? What works on mobile devices? And, most importantly: can we abstract away the differences between them and arrive at a solution that Just Works?</p>
            <p>Well... it's complicated. I'll be sharing the battle scars I've earned while working on scripty2 and the Gowalla web site. I'll try to explain how (and why) we got here, what works where (both on the desktop and on mobile devices), and what the challenges are for frontend developers who want to do bulletproof animation in web browsers.</p>

            <p>It doesn't matter whether you write JavaScript for the client, the server, or for both. It doesn't matter what library or framework you use. It doesn't matter what templating engine or node modules you rely on. The end result is HTML. And if your HTML sucks, what was the point? If you've been thinking markup was someone else's concern, guess what, sweetcheeks: it's not - it's yours. We obsess over extra semi-colons but we'll add container element after container element to provide hooks for our jQuery plugins? Uh-uh. If there's no craftsmanship involved in the way you handle HTML, it's time to change that.</p>

            <p>The special relationship between your HTML markup and browsers is one more interesting than you'd think. 
            In this session we'll cover pedantic differences like "elements" vs "tags" but also get into what it means 
            that HTML is both markup and a serialization but definitely not the DOM. You'll also learn shortcuts with 
            HTML that save you time. In the end, you'll have a better understanding of how browsers handle your work.</p>

            <p>Co-author of yepnope.js and developer of Send to Dropbox, I work for GroupCard out of Milwaukee as a front end Software Engineer. Micro frameworks are the new HTML5, and I'll show you how to squeeze as many bytes as possible out of your morbidly obese code so it makes the cut. I'll whet your palette by covering the basic transformations that JavaScript minfiers make, then bring on the main course with techniques for dealing with JavaScript reserved words and object properties. For dessert, I'll serve up a tasty knowledge bomb as to how the gzip algorithm works at a high level and how that affects minifying and gzipping your code. When you're done with this meal you'll be full! However, your code will be so lean and sexy that it will probably leave you, get drunk with ender.js and come home with a mircojs.com tattoo in the morning. You've been warned.</p>
